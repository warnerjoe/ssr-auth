This is a simple Node API server using MVC architecture and Jest for Unit testing.

To use this User auth server:

1) In the /src/config folder, open fake.env
2) Copy your MONGO_URI into the fake.env's MONGO_URI = 
3) Replace the JWT_SECRET with a secret phrase of your own, make it as secure as humanly possible.
4) Rename fake.env to .env
